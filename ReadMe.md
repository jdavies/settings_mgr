# ReadMe.md

Settings Manager is an addon to simplify saving and loading project settings
across multiple Blender files. It helps in the following areas:

1. Standardizing metadata (like copyright info) across projects. This means your company can decide in a single copyright notice that you can easily apply across all projects.
1. Standardizing rendering engines and all of their associated complex settings across projects
1. Ever do a tutorial where your results don't match those of the tutorial? Well now you can quickly ensure that your Blender settings match those of the tutorial author!

## Installation

Download and install the compiled version of the addon in the usual manner for Blender

## Limitations

Settings Manager does not save and load every single setting in your Blender file. Here are some types of settings that it will not handle:

### No Plans for the Future

1. Object Data - I have no plans to store object data in the future. That's what the .blend is for
1. Scene cameras, backgrounds and other complex items - I do not plan to add these in the future

### Possible Future Expansion

I am considering adding the following to the Settings Manager addon in the future, expecially if there is any demand for it.

1. Materials - I do plan to add materials, simply because that's where I sometimes come across problems when following tutorials.
1. Textures

## Release Notes
