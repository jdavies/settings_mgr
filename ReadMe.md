Settings Manager is an addon to simplify saving and loading project settings
across multiple Blender files. It helps in the following areas:

1. Standardizing metadata (like copyright info) across projects. This means your company can decide in a single copyright notice that you can easily apply across all projects.
1. Standardizing rendering engines and all of their associated complex settings across projects
1. Ever do a tutorial where your results don't match those of the tutorial? Well now you can quickly ensure that your Blender settings match those of the tutorial author!

## Installation

Download and install the compiled version of the addon in the usual manner for Blender
